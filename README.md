# Mod8project

# Which changes did your team choose to implement in the running-config?
The three changes that we chose to do were simple ones, but can be changed out for anything else.  But we chose changing the hostname, setting the interface 
discription, and changing the interface ip address.

# Why were these features chosen?
We thought that this would just be a good place to start.  These are things that can happen often, and we thought that they would be easy to change
into something else if needed down the line

# Describe the YANG Model chosen
There wasn't a really deep look at the specific YANG model, we were just using a generic one.  If we new more about the specific devices that 
are being used we can change the model to work better with those devices.

# Provide example output of running code showing:
running-config before changes

# Reflection points â€“ what issues have you faced while working on this activity, how did you find solutions, what have you learned, etc.
The biggest issue that I was having was just trying to get it all to connect to webex. I had a really hard time with trying to get it to send a message and connect 
to the webex team chat.  After a while I was able to find something online with some code and explainations that helped me to better understand
that got it working.
